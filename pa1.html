<h3>Goals:</h3>
This assignment is intended to familiarize you with the SPIM
environment for later assignments; to test your understanding of pointer
implementations and procedure call conventions.

<h3>Your task:</h3>
Implement mergesort using the MIPS instruction set outlined in the
SPIM documentation and in lecture.<p>

Look at <A HREF="mergesort.c">mergesort.c</a> for a C version of the mergesort
routine.  Your job is to add the required assembly code to the skeleton file,
<A HREF="mergesort.s"> mergesort.s</a>, such that the assembly code has the
same functionality as the C code. The skeleton file can be copied to
your local directory:<p>
<code> cp /usr/class/ee182/WWW/Projects/PA1/mergesort.s .</code><p>

Comments within mergesort.s clearly specify the functionality that needs
to be added.<p>

<h3>Guidelines:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Read Chapter 3 (3.1 - 3.11) before you start. Be sure to follow the
      procedure call convention detailed in Appendix A.6. You may also
      find Appendix A.9 and A.10 very helpful.
  <li>Make sure that all function arguments are passed according to the
      established convention! The arguments shall be passed in the following
      order: pointer to the first element of the array, left index,
      right index. The left and right indices mark off the portion of the
      array that will be sorted by the call to the mergesort routine.
      The first call to mergesort will pass <code>0</code> and
      <code>num_of_elements - 1</code> as the left and right indices
      respectively.
  <li>Follow the register and procedure call conventions
      (i.e., which registers are intended for what use and the sequence of
      steps in a procedure call).  Appendix A of the textbook is a good
      reference in this respect.
      Compilers have to follow the conventions so you should, too.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3>Hints:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be sure you have a good understanding of how a procedure call works
    before you attempt to code.<br>
<li>The assignment is reasonably straightforward and shouldn't take too
    much more than 80 or 90 lines of assembly.  If you have much more
    than that then maybe you should look at it again.
<li>You can work on any platform you like, but it is your responsibility to
    make sure your project will run on the leland workstations, which is the
    <b>only</b> platform we support.


</ul>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>By 10/14/99 11:59 PM, you should electronically submit your project. The
      directory you submit must have a <code>README</code> file and your
      <code>mergesort.s</code>
      <br>Please see the <a href = "../submit.html">submission instructions</a>
      for details.
  <li>The TAs will be testing your code using the spim that runs on the UNIX
      machines at Sweet Hall. 
      <em>Use spimsal and other platforms at your own risk.</em>
      It is <b>your</b> responsibility to make sure that your
      code runs correctly on the Sparc stations at Sweet Hall.
  <li>Add code to your local copy of mergesort.s, but DO NOT CHANGE any of the
      ORIGINAL mergesort.s code. If you think there's a bug, please email the
      TAs before you make any changes.
  <li>We should be able to run your program by issuing the command<p>
      <code>spim -file mergesort.s < inputfile > outputfile</code><p>
      where <code>inputfile</code> is a file representing an array of integers.
      The first number in the file specifies the number of integers in the
      array. The subsequent integers are the actual array elements.
      For example, this <a href = "sampleinput"><code>inputfile</code></a>
      should generates this <a href ="sampleoutput"><code>outputfile</code></a>
      with the above command.
</ul>

Good luck and happy sorting!<p>
